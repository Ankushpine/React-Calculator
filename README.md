A basic React calculator built using the React JavaScript library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator consists of a user interface with buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, รท), and functions (clear, equals), and a display area where the input and output of calculations are shown.
